Introduction and description of the project: This project is a proposal for an Autonomous Robot, developed from modifications made to a radio-controlled (RC) car chassis obtained from a content creator known as ""Duke Doks" through his YouTube channel and his official website:

It was decided to use this chassis for 3D printing instead of modifying a model ordered online because the latter option presented greater design and control limitations, which could have led to complications and greater limitations when making modifications to the chassis. In contrast, using a chassis as a base and then selecting the other components and materials needed for the car's proper functioning would have been preferable. Throughout this project, several aspects had to be covered in addition to the selection and modification of the aforementioned chassis, which are:
- Mobility Management
- Power and Sensory Management
- Obstacle Management

The first point refers to the choice and origin of the chassis selected for the car; that is, whether it is purchased, printed, or made completely from scratch. In our case, we have already mentioned where the selected chassis model came from and the reasons for our choice, which can be summarized as greater design control, decision-making, and, in short, a wider range of possibilities and freedom to modify and test with other components not considered in the original design. For example, changing the motor controller of an RC car ESC to a power H-bridge.

The second part of the project focuses on how the robot had to perform its most basic functions, specifically forward movement, reverse movement, and steering. For the forward and reverse motion, we selected a 21T 540 brushed motor because it provides enough torque to drive a gear system located at the rear of the robot. This gear system is connected to a shared axle for the two rear wheels, allowing the robot to move forward and backward through rear-wheel drive powered by the motor. To ensure proper operation of the traction motor, we implemented a BTS7960 H-bridge to control its direction. This was necessary because the brushed motor requires a high current, making it incompatible with more delicate H-bridges, such as the commonly used L298N. Regarding steering, we decided to use an MG996R high-torque servo motor. This choice was made because the MG996R features metal gears, providing greater durability compared to more common models like the SG90. The SG90, with its internal plastic gears, is more prone to stripping and therefore unsuitable for this project. In contrast, the MG996R offers the robustness needed for reliable steering. Finally, the HC-SR04 ultrasonic sensors implemented in the robot provide directional awareness. These sensors are responsible for sending and receiving signals to detect nearby objects, allowing both the servo motor and the traction motor to react accordingly.

Lastly, the third point refers to the algorithm designed and implemented for the robot. This algorithm is explained in detail in the files included in this repository, where you can find the flowchart, the pseudocode, and the final C code written for the Arduino UNO (which was the microcontroller chosen for this project). Below is a summary of how the algorithm works: Once the robot and all its electronics are powered through a LiPo battery and a voltage regulator, the system waits for an input signal—specifically, a push button connected to one of the Arduino pins. When the push button is pressed, the robot enters the void loop() and begins executing the main program. The first step is sending a signal to the H-bridge to rotate the motor clockwise, allowing the robot to move forward. During operation, two HC-SR04 ultrasonic sensors placed on the left and right sides of the robot continuously detect whether there is an object near either side. Based on this detection, the servo motor adjusts its steering direction away from the closest wall or obstacle to keep the robot moving forward safely. Additionally, a third ultrasonic sensor is mounted at the front of the robot. Its purpose is to detect obstacles directly ahead. If an obstacle is detected, the sensor sends a signal to the Arduino, which then commands the H-bridge to reverse the motor’s direction from clockwise to counterclockwise. This causes the robot to move backward for a short moment, allowing it to avoid the detected obstacle.
