Introduction and description of the project: This project is a proposal for an Autonomous Robot, developed from modifications made to a radio-controlled (RC) car chassis obtained from a content creator known as ""Duke Doks" through his YouTube channel and his official website:

The same document contains the download link for the .STL files for 3D printing.
It was decided to use this chassis for 3D printing instead of modifying a model ordered online because the latter option presented greater design and control limitations, which could have led to complications and greater limitations when making modifications to the chassis. In contrast, using a chassis as a base and then selecting the other components and materials needed for the car's proper functioning would have been preferable. Throughout this project, several aspects had to be covered in addition to the selection and modification of the aforementioned chassis, which are:
- Mobility Management
- Power and Sensory Management
- Obstacle Management
